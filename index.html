<p2><center>This is my family and I attempting to play music for the first time ever!!!! This was my sisters second time playing the bass guitar and the bass guitar's second day out of the box. I told my sister to play between the third and fifth fret of the first string and she did amazing! This was my dad's 4th time playing the drums and the first time maintaining a rhythm! He has been figuring it out on his own! Lastly and not as impresive, this was my 4th week playing the electric guitar and attempting to improvise. I am learning scales, so for me this was a form to practice experimenting with scales to improvise. I mess up a lot...so remember that I am learning! &#128517; &#128071;</center></p2>
