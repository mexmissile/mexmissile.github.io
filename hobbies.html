          <p>
            I am interested in French culture. I enjoy learning about France and its rich history.
						It wasn't until my trip to France when I started to increasingly appreciate art and history.
						I also enjoy watching the French news and random youtube videos in French.
						I love talking to the walls in French, because I don't have any French friends to practice with!
						I do have a couple friends who speak French, but they are not around and I'm trying to hit the next level.
